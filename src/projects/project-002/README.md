## What is this project?

A fun wave simulator that really tickled the physics part of my brain. The viewer can control the amplitude, frequency and speed of the waves (all words that I hadn't thought about since university) and add a bit of chaos into the display by increasing the noise. They can also pick a base colour and increase the number of waves which decrease in opacity towards the back.
