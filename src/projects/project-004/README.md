## What is this project?

Grid is linked to text input, either from active keyboard typing or text input. Each square is linked to a key/letter and reacts every time that key/letter is pressed.

### TOZOs

- Add tooltips on the control to instruct the user on how to use the animation
- Squares react to typing on a key board, or submitted text input
- Text appears over the top of design
- Squares change colour
- Squares change size
- Loads of squares
- Add a fullscreen function
- Have another go at updating z-index by sorting squares and changing drawing order
